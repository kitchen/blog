Last weekend I took the [California Motorcycle Safety Course][camsp] at the West Valley Occupational Center in Woodland Hills.
I've been meaning to do this for a very long time, and I finally just went ahead and registered to get it done.
I'm really happy I did.
Not only was the course quite informative and educational, it was a whole lot of fun.

I've never really ridden a motorcycle that much before.
When I was much younger, I rode a dirt bike around in a field for a while, and a couple of years ago I rode a friend of mine's bike about 30 feet in an alley, but other than that have no experience whatsoever on a motorcycle.
I was a bit nervous, especially about just getting out there on time, but it ended up being a pretty laid back affair.

Zig from [Avenger Cycle Works][avenger] was our main instructor for the day.
He and his assistants were excellent at coaching us when we were doing things not quite correctly, and making us think about what we did wrong instead of just telling us.

I recommend taking this course for anyone interested in motorcycles, as some of the "not by the book" advice we received from our veteran riding coaches will be invaluable when the time comes to get my own bike and get on the road.
It's a safe, controlled, non-intimidating environment to get a feel for how the bike works, how it reacts, and how to perform some basic maneuvering and operation.

Now I just need to wait for my form to come in the mail, make an appointment with the DMV to get my license, get a bike, and start riding!

I must admit I am still a bit nervous about the whole riding thing, but I'm sure that will change when I actually get on a bike and get going!
