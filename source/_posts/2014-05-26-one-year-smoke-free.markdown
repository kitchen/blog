Saturday night at about 1am was the first anniversary of me being smoke free! Woo!

It was pretty rough for the first several weeks, but overall it's been a breeze. Thankfully, I had some help from the fine folks at [/r/stopsmoking](http://reddit.com/r/stopsmoking) who both helped me get started and helped keep me going when the cravings got pretty bad.

The biggest realization I had which made it really easy for me to quit was the fact that the only enjoyment I was getting out of smoking was relief from the withdrawal symptoms.
I wasn't *actually* enjoying smoking most of the time.
Sure, there may have been times where it felt good or it enhanced a particularly pleasurable sitation (and those are the triggers which have been the worst to deal with) but for the most part I didn't actually enjoy it, it's just something I did.

If you're considering quitting, I highly recommend it, of course.
I'm here if you need any help with it or someone to vent to if the cravings are getting bad!
