Tonight I'm heading up to San Francisco for [PuppetConf 2012](http://puppetconf.com/)!

I'm really looking forward to this conference, the talks they have lined up look really amazing.
My only regret is that I can't be in more than one place at a time.
Hopefully they'll record all of the talks and make them available online, as I imagine a lot of them would serve as excellent documentation.

Here's the schedule of talks I'll be attending:

Hope to see some folks there!
