This weekend I'm attending [SCaLE 11x][scale11x].
I've been to the conference a few times in the past and it's always been a good time and excellent opportunity for networking and learning.

If you're going to be there and want to meet up for a beer or something, drop me an email and we'll meet up!

I'll also be at the [PGP key signing party][pgpparty] Saturday night, let's meet up and swap signatures!
