You may have noticed some downtime on the site this last week. Sorry about that.

The site used to be hosted on my old machine I had from when I was working for [DreamHost][dh].
Sadly, it had to be moved from one datacenter to the other and it didn't survive.
And, considering I don't work there anymore, replacement hardware was not readily available.

Fortunately, the hard drives were fine, so I was able to recover them.
I still need to extract the data from them and get the rest of my sites online, but getting my blog back up was my top priority.

I've currently got the site up and running at [Linode][linode].
I chose them because they have a great reputation, static IPs, IPv6 adresses, and aren't overly expensive (this 512MB vps is $20/mo).
I'd like to get back to a dedicated / colocated machine at some point, but for now this should suffice.
I don't need a lot of space, I don't need a lot of cpu power, so why not just go with something easy?

Also, let this be a lesson for you: my dns remained functional because about a year ago I bought a [BitFolk][bitfolk] VPS to run my offsite dns for me.
BitFolk has been really great, their mailing list is active and knowledgeable, their staff friendly, prompt and also knowledgeable ~~and I can VPN through it to watch BBC~~.

Anywho, sorry for the outage.
I hope to have everything back up and running in another day or so.
For now, I'm off to bed!
