Tonight I'm heading up to San Francisco for PuppetConf 2012!

I'm really looking forward to this conference, the talks they have lined up look really amazing.
My only regret is that I can't be in more than one place at a time.
Hopefully they'll record all of the talks and make them available online, as I imagine a lot of them would serve as excellent documentation.

Here's the schedule of talks I'll be attending:

And here's a list of the talks I'll hopefully be able to download videos of afterward:

If you're going to be going to PuppetConf 2012 and want to meet up, just toss me a mention on twitter and we'll get together for a beer or 10.
I will definitely be heading to 21st Amendment probably Thursday night after the VMWare social bar, so you might just look for me there!

Hope to see some folks there!
