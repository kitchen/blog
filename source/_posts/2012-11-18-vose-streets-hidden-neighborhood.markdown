The entrance to this neighborhood is partially blocked by what appears to be 2 properties that have encroached on the short street.
The passage past the 2 properties is very narrow, and gives this place an atmosphere of a hidden neighborhood.
Once past the gateway, everything seems to be as a normal street would be with street parking and a full-sized road.

The end of the street, where there would normally be a cul-de-sac also seems to have been encroached upon by the neighbor to the north, so half of the cul-de-sac is walled in behind someone's property.
I wonder if the 3 encroachments are somehow related.

I've walked my dog down to this neighborhood quite a bit, and would actually love to own one of the homes along this street, simply because of the 'hiddenness' of it.
