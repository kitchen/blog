Hello, my name is Jeremy Kitchen.

Here are some other things about me: 

* I am a Systems Engineer by trade.
* I live in Van Nuys, CA.
* I work for [NationBuilder][nationbuilder]
* I have a corgi. <!--- I should probably link to him here -->
* I ride my bike a lot.
* I'm learning to run. (barefoot)

Here are some ways to contact me:

* twitter: [@kitchen][twitter]
* email: [kitchen@kitchen.io][mail]
* github: [@kitchen][github]
* xmpp: [kitchen@scriptkitchen.com][jabber]
* cell: 708-805-4655
* irc: jkitchen on [freenode][freenode]

I also have a [GPG key][gpgkey] if you're into that sort of thing (I am, and you should be too). <!--- I should make up a post about gpg and link to it there -->
My key's fingerprint is: `E025 49FD 897E 0385 0505  2462 BEB4 4149 6300 CC3D`

What's with the tagline, you ask?
Well.
There's [this guy on reddit][shittywatercolour] who randomly illustrates people's comments in watercolors. (Sue me, I'm American, dammit)
He may have been shitty in the beginning, but he's decidedly *unshitty* nowadays.
I also read somewhere that you only get better at writing if you write, and since my main reason for not writing is that I feel like I don't write good, I should probably do this.

My aim here is not to become internet famous like Shitty\_Watercolour.  
My aim is to write some stuff, maybe some stuff someone might someday read, maybe not.  
My aim is to become a better writer, so I can communicate more effectively.  
My aim is to put my thoughts in writing so I can look back 10 years from now and know what was going through my head because I put it in words rather than trying to figure out "wtf was I thinking" while looking at a piece of my code.  
My aim is to enjoy using a handful of tools to do something, and to have a purpose for sitting down in front of my keyboard rather than watching cat videos on youtube.  
My aim.  
Is to better myself as a person through writing.  

Maybe I can help you, while I'm at it?
