My call sign is [KK6AKZ][qrz-KK6AKZ].

And that's about it, for now!


Here are some of my favorite ham radio resources:

* [ARRL][arrl] - The ARRL Website
* [Ham Nation on TWiT][hamnation] - The weekly ham radio podcast on the TWiT network.
* [aprs.fi][aprs.fi] - Google maps with APRS information overlay.
